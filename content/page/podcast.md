## My Favourite Podcasts

I enjoy Podcasts. They are unique from other means of entertainment (apart from the very similar Audiobooks and music) that can be consumed without having to directly look at, or be occupied by them; thus allowing one to perform other, often menial, tasks without succumbing to mind numbing boredom.

My favourite podcasts range across a wide variety of topics, some of which I have listed below. As with the times, my tastes and preferences are subject to change. As of late, I have decided to tend more towards long-form podcasts, consumed in shorter sprints. Consequentially, some of my choices may be considered more serious and thought provoking as opposed to the light hearted ones that used to occupy more space on this page.

One of my favourite podcasts focuses more on the technical side of the field of Economics, it is [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money) by NPR and it's miniature daily sister podcast, [The Indicator from Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/567724614/the-indicator). Every episode, these podcasts explore fun stories about the world and analyse them through the lens of economics, often explaining concepts in the subject on the way.

Another great podcast is [Freakonomics Radio](https://freakonomics.com/). It is a unique show that delves into "the hidden side of everything". They explore more quirky topics and have generally longer episodes. They have also now expanded into the 'Freakonomics Radio Network' which encompasses more podcasts I enjoy such as 'The Economics of Everyday Things', 'People I Mostly Admire' and 'No Stupid Questions'.

One of the pioneers of the podcast format is [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) by Roman Mars. Every episode gives light to the profound role yet often overlooked role that design plays in our everyday lives (hence the name, 99% Invisible). They have a wide range in terms of the topics they address but each and every episode is of the highest quality in all aspects including production quality and writing. Their current ongoing series about The Power Broker is riveting, and an indulgence.

One podcast I've found myself gravitating more towards lately is [The Seen and the Unseen – Hosted by Amit Varma](https://seenunseen.in/). I hope this marks a shift in my own perception to be more inward regarding the state of politics in my own home country, not just of others. It's not just about politics, but interviews a large variety of 'intellectuals' within India. Though certainly not for everyone, I'd encourage people to give it a chance. Each episode is quite different, depending on the interviewee, so not every episode suites all tastes.
