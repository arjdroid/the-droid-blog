## About Me

Hello there, I'm Arjun! I have a lot of interests, and love to talk. I can go on for hours branching from one topic of convesation to another. I try to enjoy all that life has to offer, and learn something new every day. I love meeting new people, and exploring the great outdoors. I am a sucker for good Sci-Fi.

## My Life Stack

Smartphone: I've been trying to use my phone less, and mostly succeeded in that endeavour. Still, when I need to drop a message, check my emails, or consult The Calendar, my experiences are ameliorated by the Pixel 9 Pro. The cameras on it are pretty great too!

Computers: I have a desktop PC at home (Ryzen 7 3700X, RTX 3070), and a Thinkpad T480s running Fedora Workstation. My primary computer that's always with me however, is my M1 MacBook Air.

Coffee: Aeropress and Light Roasts are the way to go. No cream, no sugar.

Cameras: I carry around the Sony RX-100 II for when I want to take a more meaningful photograph than one I might take with my smartphone. Sometimes I even step up to my Olympus OM-D E-M10 II. Prime lenses are what I prefer: 45mm, and 17mm (90mm and 35mm in Full Frame Equivalent).

## About This Website

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a relatively simple, open-source engine for building great static HTML websites.

The Hugo theme that I am using is [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/), by [Jimmy Cai](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/), albeit a very out-of-date version onto which I have tacked on modifications to keep it compliant with newer Hugo versions.

This website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) (specifically, via Github Pages), a fantastic resource enabling open-source content to be distributed accessibly worldwide.

Most of the edits to this site were made in [Atom](https://atom.io) a 'hackable text editor for the 21st century'.

Nowadays I primarily use [Zed](https://zed.dev), the spiritual successor to Atom now that the latter is no longer supported. I have tried getting into [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and `helix` but I haven't found the initial benefits worthwhile enough to spend time switching and configuring them. I do make heavy use of `neovim` in the CLI.

My preferred Linux distribution of choice has hopped, from Pop!\_OS to Arch Linux before settling on Fedora for good. Although I now primarily operate off an M1 MacBook Air, more of my thoughts on this can be read on my post about the Year of the Linux Desktop.

All the photographs that appear on this website are shot by me, either on an [Olympus](https://www.olympus-global.com/) [OMD E-M10 Mark II](https://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/om_d_system_cameras/om_d/e_m10_mark_ii/index.html) micro-four-thirds digital mirrorless camera or Sony RX-100, or on my smartphone (Currently a Google Pixel 9 Pro).
