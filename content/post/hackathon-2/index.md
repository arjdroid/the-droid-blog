This article ought to serve as a post-mortem of what went wrong with my second time attempting to participate in a Hackathon. Nowadays I try to be upfront about my shortcomings, because I can't bear the burden of maintaining a shiny public persona while feeling ashamed about my lived reality; I want to publicise my failures so that I can spend my energy finding and working on what I truly want to work on. This as opposed to dwelling on what 'people' might think if they knew how often I've failed at and quit things before moving onto something else that I hoped might better engage me. This realisation has come over time, as I've observed this pattern of behaviour in myself over and over again.

Objectively, my partaking in ACM UCSD's DiamondHacks 2025 was a failure. I did not adequately plan, nor execute a vision. It is a complete juxtaposition to everything I did the first time around in [hackathon].

If I were to contrast it with Codefest 2023, here would be the `diff`:
\- actually planning out the software's architecture
\- 2 teammates
\- actually learning the tech stack before the clock starts

Looking at my thought process from a week before that Hackathon began (which can be audited on the git history of this blog post on my GitHub), I can see that I would have done well to listen to https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-thing, and still should right now!

I might be repeating the same mistake with trying to re-start `chalybeate`, which is not a surprise given that its the same project re-named, just that I now have a cool name that I hope doesn't get squatted on Rust's crates.io, and that might provide me an arbitrary deadline in line with the advice offered by https://structuredprocrastination.com
