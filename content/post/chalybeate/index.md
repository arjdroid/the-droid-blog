I want to document the documents I come across while working on this project. 

I am aware that utils like the crate `hygg` already exist, but I want to create something of my own that is completely to my preferences.

Seems to be some good work out there by the folks at w3, and by extension, readium, on the front of standardising epubs and publishing good verification and access tools. 

However, now I'm using their tool `epubcheck` and seem to be finding none of my epub files are actually compliant...

I guess the first step is just a simple hand-rolled parser.
