> did Claude Code make me an AI bro? [[AI and Programming]]

A couple months ago, someone important to me asked me a deceptively simple question, "what are your thoughts on AI?". I wanted to give them the well-thought-out and nuanced answer they deserved, but the best I could muster up on the spot was something along the lines of "I don't really know what to believe", and "the hype cycle is not sustainable". 

This blog should be what I said then.

Over the past couple of months I've been trying to figure out how I should be feeling about this, I mean its been 3 years since the release of ChatGPT (I know AI has been a hot topic for decades longer than that).

Almost since day 1, I've had a subscription to ChatGPT Plus. For the longest while, I've been off and on about actually admiring it.

The most prevalent use I've seen thus far is for academic dishonesty. And I've been squeamishly running from AI in almost a luddite fashion just to get away from that association. In trying to run away from it, intentionally only doing things by hand as far as possible, I was making the same mistake (in mindset) as my fellow college students; I was only seeing gen AI, llms, whatever you want to call it, as a way to cheat on homework [[#tangent 1]]. 

After getting home for winter break a couple weeks ago, I finally decided to switch that almost 3-year long subscription from ChatGPT Plus to Claude Pro. I wanted to use Claude Code after hearing so much hype about it on HackerNews. (I know I could have used Codex or Copilot CLI, but first mover advantage, the name and trust of a brand is really powerful for humans even if you're aware of it)
> could make the tangents a little shorter OR actually I like this idea better: make it a footnote!!!!

What did I use it for? I had some projects that had been sitting on my mind for months, but there was always another homework assignment for me to work on, or exam to study for, or big rock for me to climb. Still, I would read up on docs, occasionally a new Chat window that would inevitably disappoint me, etc. but never really getting started on the actual code itself. Claude Code made it so _fun!_. I was able to get into a new stack, piece together components I thought would've been rather complex, and just ship something. It was quite quick and easy to get 80% of the job done, the only limitation really is how much I _care_ for that last 20%. [typcraft](https://typcraft.nxtdroid.win) is live now. There are still a lot of things I could do to make it nicer, but my attention has already moved on (there's always something more fun to do, especially when it comes to anything that's not school or work)

I had a pretty decent idea of what I wanted to get done, just not the actual mechanical writing of code. The back and forth conversation with Opus 4.5 is very productive and allowed me to steer it away from unnecessary complexity, I wanted to keep the code as _simple as possible_.

>seems performative again ahahahaha

It's crazy how good Claude Code is, and how much better it could be. This [talk]() by Steve Yegge and Gene Kim is really good, and paints a picture of what the next couple of months could look like in AI-driven development.

###### tangent 1
I, ostensibly, don't want to cheat on homework because (in my mind) I'm paying boatloads of money to learn rather than get a degree. However, I can totally see why the incentive structure of _a college degree_ and the _job market_ has made passing off one's assignments to a rational choice. If you see the homework as something in the way between you and a degree which would lead to a job, then it may be understandable what you're doing. I am trying to be a hipster, and this is vaguely performative – especially by penning it down in a blog post that will be seen by very few humans – but its along the same lines as cutting off social media and trying to read more for me; I don't really care what other people are doing, but I don't want it for myself. Perhaps its to the same extent with drinking (wherever its legal) and sugar and all those other things too; I know it brings a lot of joy to a lot of people, but I don't want it.
