attended talk by prof Gandhi, open courseware really makes knowledge and learning accessible. credentials can always come after, but the knowledge is what's really important.

my own experiences as a college student
	when I had *time* this is what I should've spent it doing
- neat platforms make learning more fun and engaging

reading is still really important, summaries aren't the same thing, but reading doesn't just mean staring at a big block of text

prof politz and carr's courses

this is the cool boring stuff that venture capitalists don't get excited about 

don't pour money into those corporations that shan't be named for fear of libel, just do good work

- carnap
- prairielearn
- ~~algorithmsbook~~
- ~~opentakshashila~~
- khanacademy

these have been a lot more interesting than the traditional textbooks for courses which charge me hundreds of dollars

the approach sounds cliche but its really about the journey not the destination... if you don't enjoy actually doing the work, then it's going to be a slog

# structure
- intro - why am I writing this? I haven't seen it talked about but I've been hearing a lot about it and I think it's really cool and I want to gather my thoughts on it by actually writing about it
	- perhaps if I become an academic, I really don't know, life could go down so many paths, I will look back at this and find it useful to remember if ever designing my own courses (although first I need to know what I'm doing before parting knowledge onto others)
- why is it important?
- what are some cool ones, why are they cool?
- takeaways?
- 

make sure to pick a scope and stick to it. maybe a couple of obsidian notes will spin out of this; I will be able to re-use said knowledge

maybe stick to my perspective as a student in 2026. also, by writing these down, hopefully the ideas stick in my head so I can learn better too
