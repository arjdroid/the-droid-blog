## Introduction

A little over a month ago, I decided to participate in my high school's yearly [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon). Living in a tech-oriented city like Bengaluru has its perks.

I haven't really had much formal programming experience, long-winded language tutorials that start from the ground up didn't agree with me. Instead I've mostly jumped around and played with things like linux and docker, making the occasional shell script or configurations to make things work how I wanted, as this blog has shown.

This was going to be the first time I wrote some 'real' code; I was very excited.

## Advice

I don't want to bore you with the minute-by-minute details so let me just list some advice I wish I knew beforehand, as well as advice I thought would be obvious to others but apparently was not

> * Preparation
> * Equipment
> * Caffeine
> * Focus on the Timeline

### Preparation

This was obviously the most timetaking aspect of the hackathon but also one of the most important. I took the approach that made the most sense to me. I first formulated what I wanted to create for the competition, in my case an Environmentally Friendly Route Planning App. It fit into two of the competition's available themes: Environmental Sustainability and Transportation.

You should tailor your project towards the requirements of the hackathon, following whatever themes and other specifications they lay out.

#### Tech Stack

I also carefully thought about the tech stack I was going to use. My first choice was to go for a traditional web-app built with HTML + CSS + JS, and I did extensive research over the course of two weeks to ascertain the viability of this. Ultimately, I didn't like the structure as it would branch out to be more complex than I wanted, requiring backend servers and things of that sort, so I instead opted to shift to a mobile app.

This is where I stumbled across [Flutter](flutter.dev). It's a cross-platform open-source framework by Google to develop apps for Android, Linux, macOS, iOS, Windows and the Web all from one codebase. I also compared it to Facebook's [React Native](reactnative.dev) but I preferred flutter so I started work on learning the in's and out's of it.

During this time I also found all the relevant API's I wanted to use (such as OpenWeather and GoogleMapsPlatform) and figured out how they'd fit into my app.

And definitely don't forget to set up all your API keys beforehand; I made the mistake of not properly choosing my weather API, forcing me to switch last minute, only to find out that my freshly minted API key would take 2 hours to initialise before I was allowed to use it!

> Settle on a proper tech stack that suits your needs

#### Team Members

My next step was to recruit team members. This was quite difficult as my strategy was quite different from most other teams I saw, which already had a group of friends that formed a team and then came up with an idea.

After screening a lot of potential team members from my school, I narrowed down my list and interviewed until I found a good fit. The max team size allowed was 5 but I kept only 3 members. I initially planned to go solo (most of the winning teams I saw were solo too) but decided that the workload would be more bearable with teammates and it would also be more fun.

I also had daily meetings with my team members over the 2 weeks before the competition to ensure we were always on the same page regarding things, as well as sharing ideas for our project vision and discussing technological complications

#### Practice

This was especially important for me as I had little previous experience whatsoever with using the Dart programming language (part of Flutter) or even making full-fledged applications in general. Up until then, I had focused primarily on bash and python scripts along with the occasional static website here and there as well as this blog itself. My interests always laid more towards the Linux Administration / Networking side of things.

Over the few weeks before the competition, I focused intensely on mini-projects to learn the in's and out's of the languages and API's I'd be using so I was well versed. I also allotted projects to my teammates to ensure they'd be capable of handling the UI components which is what I'd brought them on for since I didn't want to get bogged down doing UI rather than what I really wanted.

I must've made half a dozen private GitHub repos in that short period of time.

> Practice well and ensure you're thorough with any and all technologies you might use in the hackathon. Mini-projects are great for this as you pick up the exact practical skills you need, without wasting time on the basics.

### Equipment

You can't perform your best if your equipment is holding you back. Although most of this might be completely unnecessary, and definitely _can't compensate for a gap in proficiency_, they definitely do make life easier.

One of the simplest pieces of equipment I chose to carry, a **_power-strip_**, turned out to be crucial since we were offered just a single plug point so that 4-plug power-strip was a life-saver and sustained my team throughout the entire competition.

I also brought with me a dedicated **_data dongle_** (a small, portable access point that uses LTE for its uplink) as I was unsure whether the event-provided internet would hold up to my needs (and those of the literally hundreds of other participants). And thank goodness I did because I ended up using it the entire competition.

My **_noise-cancelling headphones_** were also instrumental in helping me focus on my work. The background noise from packing hundreds of excited people in close quarters was as you'd expect, making it impossible to not get distracted. I'd occasionally slide one ear out of the headphones to converse with my teammates but other than that, it was smooth sailing.

Deodorant & a toothbrush - do I need to elaborate?

Something I wish I'd brought but didn't was an external mouse. I was used to using my laptop for short stints with the trackpad while comfortably utilising my desktop at home for longer sessions but I'd overlooked the need for a mouse with my laptop. As great as the trackpad on your laptop might be, a mouse is easier on the wrist, at least for me.

> Plan and bring what you need beforehand to minimise distractions and unnecessary worries

### Caffeine

I gave this a separate category because I was just surprised by the sheer volume I consumed; it would not be practical to bring this amount of coffee on your own. Initially, I thought that I'd drink just the one cup of coffee to really wake up in the morning after having a short nap at midnight (I even brought a sleeping bag for this). Little did I know, I'd end up chugging through the whole night with 12 shots of espresso, frantically attempting to implement different functions and fixing merge conflicts.

I would not advise such reckless consumption of caffeine, although it definitely helped me stay up for a long time. I only napped for half an hour before the final hour of the hackathon, after that I was up for another 12.

However, if you were to consume such quantities, I do think that coffee or tea are preferrable to 'energy' drinks, I particularly do not like them although I have witnessed many a friend down entire cans in mere minutes. Energy drinks contain a lot more additives apart from caffeine, namely sugar, which tend to make them less conducive to good long term health.

### Focus on the Timeline

This is one mistake I noticed a lot of teams (including my own to some extent) making. Every hackathon is different, but they usually have audits conducted by the organisers / judges at regular intervals where they review your current progress and milestones. 

As you start coding, you may realise that your estimates on how long you'd take to implement features may change drastically, sometimes quicker but more often slower than you'd expected. It's essential to be flexible about re-thinking what you can and cannot achieve in your limited time frame. Don't succumb to the [sunk-cost fallacy](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy) - pouring more time (& other resources) into a dead-end, even after you know it's a dead, because you've already 'sunk' so much into it.

There will probably be features that you have to abandon, even if you spent hours to get half-way into implementing it, to make sure that you get to the finish line with a presentable project.

With this, I conclude my short list of advice I would've wanted to be given in a concise manner before embarking upon my first hackathon.

If you are considering participating in one, I highly recommend it. You learn a lot and hopefully, make many friends along the way. It also went a long way in demystifying 'programming' in general for me.
